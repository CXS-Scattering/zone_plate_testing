## zone_plate_testing

Codes for creating zone plate patterns and to study their performance. Effects of tilting the zone plate can also be studied.

*create_zp.ipynb*       - creates a zone plate according to the input parameters. <br>
*create_rings.ipynb*    - creates rings according to the input parameters. <br>
*simulate_zp.ipynb*     - performs multislice simulation to evaluate the performance of the zone plate. <br>
*simulate_tilt.ipynb*   - effects of tile on zone plate performance. <br>
*analyze_tilt.ipynb*    - analyze the effects of tile on zone plate performance. <br>
*simulate_var_width_thickness.ipynb*   - effects of tile on zone plate performance for a various thicknesses and number of zones! <br>

Dependencies :  uses the multislice module.
Each file can be exported as a .py file and run !
