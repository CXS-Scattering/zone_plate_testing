## zone_plate_geometry

*create_zp.py*    - creates a zone plate according to the input parameters.
*simulate_zp.py*  - performs multislice simulation to evaluate the performance of the zone plate.
*prop.py*         - contains the code for fresnel propogation that will be used for multislice simulation.

Each python code has an associated ipython notebook explaining (and documenting!) how the code works.
