## zone_plate_geometry

#A code to create a zone plate geometry with partial filling of pixels depending on how much of the zone plate in enclosed by it.

*create_disc.py*  - creates a circle on a grid.

*create_zp.py*    - uses the above and creates a zone plate !

TODO : Each python code has an associated ipython notebook explaining (and documenting!) how the code works.
