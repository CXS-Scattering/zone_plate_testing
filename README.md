## zone_plate_geometry

*create_zp.py*    - creates a zone plate according to the input parameters. <br>
*simulate_zp.py*  - performs multislice simulation to evaluate the performance of the zone plate. <br>
*prop.py*         - contains the code for fresnel propogation that will be used for multislice simulation. <br>

zp.npy - test zone plate array <br>
parameters.pickle - file containing the parameters associated with the zone plate simulation <br>


Each python code has an associated ipython notebook explaining (and documenting!) how the code works.
